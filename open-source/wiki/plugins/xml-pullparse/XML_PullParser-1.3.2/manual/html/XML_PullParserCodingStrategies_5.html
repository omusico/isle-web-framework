  The tokenizing functions create arrays which are mapped to the structure and data of
  the xml document. It's from these that the data accessors extract text and attribute
  data.    <A href="appendix_1.html">Appendix 1</A>  has examples of
  tokens returned by some of these functions as well as notes on their structure.

<!--   REPLACEMENT MADE -->


 <span class='code'>XML_PullParser_childXCL</span>  is an important  <span class='emphasis'>selector</span>  function.
We've already seen its usefulness in the
 <A href="XML_PullParserCodingStrategies_4.html#childXCL">previous section,</A>
where it was used to strip out all child elements from the parent.  It does this when passed
a single parameter, a token representing the parent element. It is used internally in several
class methods for just this purpose.   But it can also take a second parameter, either a vairable
parameter list of strings or an array of strings. These are the names of selected elements for exclusion.
That is, they will be excluded from the returned array, which will consist of the parent and
any child elements which are not named.   <span class='emphasis'>Example 1</span>  and
 <span class='emphasis'>Listing 15</span>  demonstrate how this might be used.
</p></div>

<p><div class="block"><center><b>Example 1</b></center>

There are a number of things in this listing that we haven't seen before.  First, it uses
 <span class='code'>XML_PullParser_getTextStripped</span>  (line 12),  which ignores element boundaries and
returns a string consisting of all the character data found within the parent
element, i.e. including all text found in child elements.  Secondly, the default text
delimiter is a single space.  This is replaced in line 11 by the newline character so that
the output is printed in several lines.  Lines 3 and 4 make sure that the output is cleaned up,
since the parser will return as part of the character data any newlines it finds in the
text, which includes the newlines between the element declarations.

<p><div class="para"> We exclude  <span class='emphasis'>topsecret</span>  in line 8. Consequently, the final output

<p><div class="para"><br><span class='emphasis'>2. XML_PullParser_getChild</span><br>
This method extracts an individual child element and all its descendents from a parent.
The first parameter is a string, the name of the child element to extract from the parent.

The second is an optional  <span class='code'>$which</span>  value. It specifies which instance of the child element
to extract; the instances are treated as a sequence, which mirrors the order of appearance in the XML document.

The parent is  (optionally) specified in the 3rd parameter.
If the parent is not passed in, then it uses the  <span class='code'>$current_element</span>  or, failing that,
the current token.

</p></div>

<p><div class="para">
This method is set up so as to work effortlessly with  <span class='code'>XML_PullParser_getToken</span>  or
 <span class='code'>XML_PullParser_getElement</span> .  If either of these has been
called, and there is only one instance of the child in the xml, then all that's needed is to
call  <span class='code'>XML_PullParser_getElement</span>  with the name of the child, since  <span class='code'>$which</span>
defaults to 1.  Otherwise, the  <span class='code'>$which</span>  has to be passed in.

To illustrate this method, let's look at the numbered list of function definitions at the top
of this page.  It's XML basis is a  <span class='emphasis'>Docbook</span>  structure called

<p><div class="para">
   By default, before the element is returned, it is filtered through  <span class='code'>XML_PullParser_childXCL,</span>

   named in the parameter to XML_PullParser_getElement:

   But this also means that it is not suitable for use in applications which need to slurp together
