XMLPullParser README


1. Installation:
    a. This distribution file is a valid Pear package and can be installed using the Pear package manager:
            pear install XML_PullParser.tgz
                OR
            pear install XML_PullParser-n1.n2.n3.tgz
                where n1.n2.n3 is the version number
 
    b. It can be installed locally using tar:
     	    tar -xzf XML_PullParser.tgz
                OR
            tar -xzf XML_PullParser-n1.n2.n3.tgz
                where n1.n2.n3 is the version number


2. The only file needed to use XML_PullParser is XML_PullParser.inc:
            require_once "install_directory/XML_PullParser.inc";        


   If the version you are using is 1.2.n or greater, then XML_PullParser.inc will attempt
   to include XML_PullParser_Errors.inc using the following code: 

      if(isset($XML_PullParser_Errors_Path) && 
                              is_readable($XML_PullParser_Errors_Path . "/XML_PullParser_Errors.inc")) {
        include ($XML_PullParser_Errors_Path . "/XML_PullParser_Errors.inc");// user-defined directory
      }
      else {
         require_once "XML_PullParser_Errors.inc";
      }

   If XML_PullParser_Errors.inc is not in the default Pear include directory or is not in the same
   local directory as XML_PullParser.inc or for some other reason cannot be found, set the package level 
   variable $XML_PullParser_Errors_Path to the directory where XML_PullParser_Errors.inc will be found. 
   Place it in your script before including XML_PullParser.inc:
            
                  $XML_PullParser_Errors_Path = "my/other/directory";
                  require_once("XML_PullParser.inc");
             

3. Documentation Directory:  manual
    manual/xml
	Manual: XML documentation written in Dockbook format.  The Manual is accessible in browsers
	through manual/xml/contents.html, which redirects the xml to a PHP script that uses
	XML_PullParser to parse and re-format the xml as html

   manual/html
	This directory contains the re-formatted Manual as html, and is accessible through
	manual/html/contents.html
			
  manual/listings
	Contains all the example code from the Manual.
  manual/listings_NS
	Contains example code relating to Namespace support
		
  manual/doc
	This is the output from phpDocumentor. It is a complete detailing of all the functions
	and methods used in XML_PullParser and will sometimes cover details not found in the Manual.

4. Tests directory: tests
	This directory contains a set of PHPUnit tests.  There is a set of scripts named t1.php, t2.php, etc.
	These can be called individually.  In addition, there is a batch script named php_unit.php which will
	run all the individual t scripts.
