===== Instructions =====
Using this tool, you can delete entries from the epub cache and, if you choose, you can also delete the associated ebooks from the media directory.
Select one or more titles.  If you click the **Cache Only** button, those titles will be removed from the cache.  If you click the **Cache and Ebook(s)** button, the
titles will be removed from the cache and their associated ebooks will be deleted from the media directory.   The latter will work only if you have left the epub
files in tact on the server.
