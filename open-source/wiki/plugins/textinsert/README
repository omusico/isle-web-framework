This is a macro substitution plugin which enables substitutions of both words and longer
strings of text.

Basic Syntax:  #@Macro_Name@#

It provides an administrative panel which makes for simple adding, editing and deletion
of macros.

Much of the functionality of this plugin can be more easily implemented with Dokuwiki's
own entities facility: http://www.dokuwiki.org/entities.  The advantage of TextInsert
comes when dealing with extended blocks of text and with its ability to include other
macros inside the primary macro definition. That is, it can accept:

MACRO_1  This macro can include #@MACR0_2@# inside it.
MACRO_2  a second macro

The result is:
    This macro can include a second macro inside it.
    
It accepts only one level of macro inclusion, so that if MACRO_3 were included in
MACRO_2, MACRO_3 would not be rendered.

The macro definitions will also accept entities defined dokuwiki's conf/entities.conf and
user-defined entities conf/entities.local.conf.  Entities will be replaced in both the
primary and the included macros.

HTML Support
#Macro_HTML@#
A macro name with the _HTML suffix will be output as HTML, whereas without the _HTML suffix the
HTML markup will be treated as literals.  With it, <p> creates a paragraph; wthout it the <p>
markup is printed to the screen.

Translation Support
#@LANG_name@#
If a macro has this format, textinsert checks the file's namespace for a language specified
as an ISO abbreviation,  for instance nl for Dutch or de for German -- as in de:my_file.  If it finds
a language specification, it will check the textinsert/lang directory for a lang.php file in the relevant
language directory, for instance lang/de/lang.php.  It will then look for a $lang['name'] entry and if
it finds one, it will substitute this for the macro. Otherwise, it will substitute the entry for 
LANG_name in the textinsert database.  So, there must be a default entry in that database.

Translation macros can be embeded in other macros, including other translation macros.
And other macros can emdedded in translation macros.  They also accept entities, as
described above.

For HTML output, HTML tags are accepted in translation macros, but for the HTML
to become effective, these must be included in a standard HTML macro definition
string. In effect, they must be doubly bound to the HTML
